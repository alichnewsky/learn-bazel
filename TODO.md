things to try:
* "software insulation techniques" : libraries with : 
  * C-style procedural interfaces
  * pure abstract interfaces
  * pointer to implementations
  * dependency injection
* segregation between headers to be exported by the library and internal ones
  * can we restrict the symbols exported by a library

* bazel : LINUX + MAC OS X
* gradle: LINUX + MAC OS X + WINDOWS
* cmake
